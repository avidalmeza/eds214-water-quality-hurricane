# Automate

##### Running the entire analysus requires rendering one Querto document
- Quarto paper rendered, although the code is not yet finished. Most of the code chunks are commented out. - Not yet

##### Data import/ cleaning is handled in its own script

NOT YET. This sections is still not ready since most of the code is commented out. The filtering, select, and mutated is giving me an error.


# Organize

#####  Raw data is contained in its own folder
Meets specs! The csv data is saved into the data folder. When uploading the csv's I uploaded the whole zip folder.


#####  Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data
NOT YET. Outputs are created, but they are not being saved into a separate folder from raw data.


##### At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
NOT YET. A function was created in the R folder with the name rolling_average.R. This is the function created during class to be applied on the spaghetti script. Not yet finalized.


# Document

#####  The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
NOT YET. It has some information, but can still add more information and be more descriptive one the README.md

#####  The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
NOT YET. The README has a flowchart, but it could be cleaned up.

#####  The code is appropriately commented
NOT Yet. I have most of it commented but some areas can use more commenting, as well as the new code i may need to add ro fix.

##### Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
Met spec. are labeled out and are descriptive to each area. 


# Scale
After cloning the repo on Workbench:
#####  Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
met spec. I have the libraries for the script at the top with a comment saying these are some libraries that will be used during this repo.


#####  The analysis script runs without errors
NOT YET. My analysis script is still running with errors that have been commented out.
